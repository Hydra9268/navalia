### Features

Navalia is a "batteries-included" framework that offers all of the following features:

- A simple, human-readable API.
- Massive parallelization by using tabs and multiple browser instances.
- Ability to capture screenshots, pdfs, execute javascript, insert text, and more into a webpage.
- Build multi-page workflows with complex user-interactions.
- Set thresholds like timers or TTL's for scripts so nothing blocks your execution.

### Getting Started

You'll need some software already installed on your system before using Navalia:

1. Chrome installed (more vendors to come soon) on your system.
2. Node.js needs to be  installed as well. You can install [node here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. If you wish to use a more strongly-typed experience, you can also install [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
